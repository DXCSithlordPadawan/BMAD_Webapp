## 1. Executive Summary

BMAD Forge is a web-based prompt engineering tool designed to generate, validate, and manage prompts that comply with the BMAD (Breakthrough Method for Agile AI-Driven Development) Framework. The application serves as a centralized platform for teams working with AI coding assistants, enabling them to create structured, consistent, and high-quality prompts that follow BMAD best practices.

The platform addresses the growing need for standardized prompt development in AI-assisted software development. As organizations increasingly adopt AI tools like GitHub Copilot, Claude, and ChatGPT for coding tasks, the quality and consistency of prompts become critical factors in achieving optimal results. BMAD Forge provides the tooling necessary to systematize prompt creation while ensuring compliance with established BMAD methodology.

This document outlines the complete requirements for building BMAD Forge, including functional specifications, technical architecture, user interface designs, and implementation guidelines. The application is built using Django 5.x for the backend, Bootstrap 5 for the frontend, and uses SQLite for development with PostgreSQL support for production deployments.

## 2. Problem Statement

### 2.1 Industry Context

The adoption of AI coding assistants has transformed software development workflows across organizations of all sizes. However, this transformation has introduced new challenges related to prompt quality, consistency, and knowledge management. Development teams struggle with several interconnected problems that impact their productivity and the quality of AI-generated outputs.

### 2.2 Core Problems

**Problem 1: Inconsistent Prompt Quality**  
Development team members create prompts independently, leading to significant variations in quality, structure, and effectiveness. Without standardized approaches, even experienced developers may miss critical context or fail to provide AI assistants with sufficient information to generate optimal responses. This inconsistency results in rework, frustration, and suboptimal AI output quality.

**Problem 2: Lack of BMAD Framework Compliance**  
The BMAD Framework provides proven methodologies for structuring effective prompts, but manual compliance checking is error-prone and time-consuming. Team members may not be familiar with all framework requirements, leading to prompts that miss essential sections or fail to follow prescribed structures. The absence of automated validation means non-compliant prompts enter the development workflow undetected.

**Problem 3: Poor Template Management**  
Organizations generate valuable prompt templates through experience and iteration, but these templates often exist only in individual developers' notes or chat histories. Without centralized management, templates are not easily discoverable, cannot be shared across teams, and are frequently recreated from scratch rather than built upon existing work.

**Problem 4: Limited GitHub Integration**  
Many organizations maintain template repositories on GitHub, but accessing and synchronizing these templates requires manual effort or custom scripts. The disconnect between template storage and the prompt engineering workflow creates friction and reduces adoption of shared templates.

### 2.5 Impact of Problems

These problems collectively result in decreased productivity, inconsistent AI output quality, wasted development effort, and limited organizational learning. Teams spend significant time recreating prompts that already exist in some form, while valuable insights about effective prompt strategies remain siloed within individual contributors.

## 3. Goals and Objectives

### 3.1 Primary Goals

The primary goals of BMAD Forge are organized into three categories that address the identified problems comprehensively.

**Goal Category 1: Prompt Quality Enhancement**  
The application must automatically validate prompts against BMAD Framework requirements, ensuring all generated prompts include required sections and follow prescribed structures. Validation should occur in real-time during prompt generation, providing immediate feedback when compliance issues are detected. The system should achieve a 95% compliance rate for prompts generated through the platform.

**Goal Category 2: Template Ecosystem Development**  
BMAD Forge must provide robust template management capabilities, including GitHub synchronization, discovery, filtering, and versioning. The platform should support seamless template imports from configured repositories and maintain metadata including agent roles, workflow phases, and update timestamps. Organizations should be able to build and share template libraries that evolve over time.

**Goal Category 3: User Experience Excellence**  
The application must deliver an intuitive, responsive user interface that encourages adoption and reduces friction in the prompt engineering workflow. Users should be able to generate compliant prompts in under five minutes from template selection to output generation. The interface must accommodate both technical and non-technical users effectively.

### 3.2 Measurable Objectives

The following specific, measurable objectives define success criteria for the project.

**Objective 1: Template Adoption**  
Achieve 80% template utilization rate, meaning 80% of generated prompts should originate from existing templates rather than being created from scratch.

**Objective 2: Validation Effectiveness**  
Achieve 100% detection rate for missing required sections and unreplaced template variables. False positive rates for validation warnings should remain below 5%.

**Objective 3: GitHub Integration**  
Enable successful synchronization of templates from GitHub repositories with 99% reliability. Sync operations should complete within 30 seconds for repositories containing fewer than 100 template files.

**Objective 4: User Satisfaction**  
Achieve average user satisfaction rating of 4.0 or higher on a 5-point scale. Target time-to-first-prompt-under-5-minutes for new users.

**Objective 5: Performance Targets**  
Page load times under 2 seconds, API response times under 500 milliseconds for 95% of requests, and 99.9% uptime for production deployments.

## 4. Target Users and Use Cases

### 4.1 Primary User Personas

BMAD Forge serves several distinct user personas, each with unique needs and interaction patterns.

**Persona 1: Software Developer**  
Software developers represent the largest user segment and primary consumers of generated prompts. They typically have moderate technical expertise and are primarily interested in quickly generating high-quality prompts for specific coding tasks. Their key needs include fast template discovery, intuitive form interfaces, and reliable validation. They access the platform several times per day, spending 2-5 minutes per session.

**Persona 2: AI/ML Engineer**  
AI and Machine Learning Engineers focus on advanced prompt engineering techniques and often create or modify templates. They have high technical expertise and require access to template source code, configuration options, and validation rules. Their needs include fine-grained control over template variables, batch operations, and integration capabilities.

**Persona 3: Project Manager**  
Project managers use BMAD Forge to understand prompt quality metrics, ensure team compliance with standards, and oversee template governance. They have moderate technical expertise and focus on aggregate views, reporting, and team-level analytics. Their key needs include dashboards, filtering capabilities, and export functionality.

**Persona 4: Product Owner**  
Product owners establish prompt engineering standards, define organizational requirements, and measure platform effectiveness. They have limited technical expertise but need visibility into usage metrics, template effectiveness, and compliance rates. Their needs include executive dashboards, ROI reporting, and strategic planning tools.

**Persona 5: DevOps Engineer**  
DevOps engineers manage platform deployment, infrastructure, and integrations. They have high technical expertise and focus on CI/CD integration, monitoring, and security. Their needs include API access, deployment automation, and operational visibility.

### 4.2 Use Cases

**Use Case 1: Prompt Generation from Template**  
A software developer needs to create a prompt for implementing user authentication. They browse the template library, filter by developer role and development phase, select an appropriate template, fill in required variables (project name, authentication requirements, technology stack), generate the prompt, validate compliance, and copy the output for use in their AI coding assistant.

**Use Case 2: GitHub Template Synchronization**  
An AI/ML engineer maintains a repository of BMAD templates for their organization. They configure GitHub synchronization settings, trigger a manual sync, review changes including new templates and updates, resolve any conflicts, and verify successful import of all templates.

**Use Case 3: Custom Template Creation**  
A senior developer identifies a need for a new template pattern. They create a new template definition with appropriate sections (Your Role, Input, Output Requirements), define template variables using standard syntax, specify agent role and workflow phase associations, test the template with sample data, and publish for team use.

**Use Case 4: Compliance Validation Review**  
A project manager reviews generated prompts for compliance. They access the prompt history view, filter by validation status (valid/invalid), drill down into specific prompts with issues, review validation notes and missing sections, and provide feedback to team members on compliance improvements.

**Use Case 5: Prompt History Analysis**  
A product owner analyzes prompt engineering effectiveness. They access the dashboard view, review template usage metrics and trends, identify underutilized templates, export usage reports, and make decisions about template investment and retirement.

## 7. Technical Architecture

### 7.1 Technology Stack

The following technology stack forms the foundation of the BMAD Forge application.

**Backend Technologies**

The backend is built using Python 3.11+ with Django 5.x framework. Django provides robust ORM capabilities, built-in admin interface, security features, and a mature ecosystem of extensions. The choice of Python aligns with AI/ML tooling ecosystems where BMAD Forge templates will be used.

Key backend dependencies include: Django 5.x for web framework, requests 2.31+ for HTTPS client operations (GitHub API integration), python-dotenv 1.0+ for environment configuration management, markdown 3.5+ for template content rendering, beautifulsoup4 4.12+ for HTML parsing during sync operations, and django-widget-tweaks 1.5+ for form rendering customization.

**Database Technologies**

SQLite is used for development and MVP deployments, providing zero-configuration setup and self-contained operation. PostgreSQL is required for production deployments, providing better concurrency, replication, and operational characteristics. Django's ORM provides database abstraction enabling both backends with identical application code.

**Frontend Technologies**

The frontend uses Bootstrap 5 for responsive UI components and grid system. Bootstrap provides consistent styling, responsive breakpoints, and accessible interactive components. Custom CSS extends Bootstrap with dark theme colors, scrollbar styling, and application-specific visual treatments.

Template rendering uses Django's template engine with Jinja2-compatible syntax. Dynamic interactions leverage vanilla JavaScript with no heavy client-side framework, keeping the application lightweight and fast.

**External Services**

GitHub API (v3) provides repository access for template synchronization. The API requires authentication tokens for private repositories and higher rate limits. No other external service dependencies exist for core functionality.

### 7.2 System Architecture

The system follows a standard three-tier architecture with clear separation between presentation, business logic, and data layers.

**Presentation Layer**  
The presentation layer handles HTTPS/TLS requests, renders HTML templates, and manages user sessions. Django views process incoming requests, invoke business logic services, and select appropriate templates for response rendering. Static assets (CSS, JavaScript) are served directly or through Django's static file handling.

**Business Logic Layer**  
The business logic layer contains all application services including template management, prompt generation, validation, and GitHub synchronization. Services are implemented as reusable Python modules with clean interfaces. This layer enforces all business rules and orchestrates operations across data access and external integrations.

**Data Layer**  
The data layer provides persistent storage for templates and generated prompts. Django models define the data schema and provide query interfaces. Database migrations manage schema evolution across versions.

**External Integration Layer**  
The external integration layer handles communication with GitHub's API. A dedicated GitHubSyncService encapsulates API interactions, authentication, and error handling. This layer provides a clean abstraction over external dependencies.

### 7.3 Component Diagram

The application comprises the following major components:

**Web Server Component**  
The web server handles HTTPS requests using Django's WSGI application. Requests are routed to appropriate views based on URL configuration. Middleware components provide session management, security filtering, and request processing hooks.

**Template Engine Component**  
The template engine parses template content, extracts variables using regex patterns, and performs variable substitution. The engine supports both double-brace (`{{VAR}}`) and single-brace (`[VAR]`) syntax variants.

**Validation Engine Component**  
The validation engine analyzes generated prompts against BMAD requirements. It checks for required sections, unreplaced variables, content length, and structural integrity. Validation results are persisted with each generated prompt.

**Sync Service Component**  
The sync service connects to GitHub API, retrieves repository contents, parses template files, and updates the local database. It handles authentication, rate limiting, and error recovery.

**Admin Interface Component**  
Django's built-in admin interface provides data management capabilities for administrators. Custom admin classes extend the base interface with appropriate display and filtering options.

### 7.4 Data Flow

**Prompt Generation Flow**  
The prompt generation flow begins when a user selects a template and accesses the generation form. The system retrieves template content and parses variable definitions. The dynamic form is generated and displayed to the user. When the user submits the form, the system validates all inputs and performs variable substitution. The generated prompt is validated against BMAD requirements. Results are stored in the database, and the user is redirected to the results view.

**Template Synchronization Flow**  
The synchronization flow begins with a user triggering a sync operation. The system authenticates with GitHub API using configured credentials. Repository contents are listed and filtered for template files. Each template file is fetched, parsed, and analyzed. Metadata including agent role and workflow phase are detected. New templates are created, existing templates are updated or skipped based on modification times. Results are logged and displayed to the user.

---

## 8. Data Models

### 8.1 Template Model

The Template model stores BMAD template definitions with all associated metadata.

```python
class Template(models.Model):
    # Core fields
    title = models.CharField(max_length=255, help_text="Template title")
    content = models.TextField(help_text="Template content with placeholders")
    agent_role = models.CharField(max_length=50, choices=AGENT_ROLES)
    workflow_phase = models.CharField(max_length=50, choices=WORKFLOW_PHASES)
    
    # Source tracking
    remote_url = models.URLField(max_length=500, null=True, blank=True)
    remote_path = models.CharField(max_length=500, null=True, blank=True)
    
    # Descriptive metadata
    description = models.TextField(null=True, blank=True)
    version = models.CharField(max_length=50, default="1.0.0")
    variables = models.JSONField(default=list, help_text="Detected variables")
    
    # Status and timestamps
    is_active = models.BooleanField(default=True)
    last_updated = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    
    class Meta:
        ordering = ['agent_role', 'workflow_phase', 'title']
        indexes = [
            models.Index(fields=['agent_role', 'workflow_phase']),
            models.Index(fields=['is_active', 'created_at']),
        ]
```

**Field Descriptions**

The `title` field stores the human-readable template name displayed in lists and cards. Maximum length of 255 characters accommodates descriptive titles while maintaining database efficiency.

The `content` field stores the complete template markdown including sections, variable placeholders, and formatting. This is the source of truth for prompt generation.

The `agent_role` field identifies the BMAD agent role associated with the template. Valid values are: orchestrator, analyst, pm, architect, scrum_master, developer, qa.

The `workflow_phase` field identifies the BMAD workflow phase associated with the template. Valid values are: planning, development.

The `remote_url` field stores the GitHub URL where the template was sourced, enabling traceability and refresh operations.

The `remote_path` field stores the file path within the repository for change detection during synchronization.

The `variables` field stores a JSON array of detected variable names. This enables form generation without reparsing content and supports search/indexing use cases.

### 8.2 GeneratedPrompt Model

The GeneratedPrompt model stores generated prompts with input data and validation results.

```python
class GeneratedPrompt(models.Model):
    # Relationship
    template = models.ForeignKey(Template, on_delete=models.CASCADE, 
                                  related_name='generated_prompts')
    
    # Content
    input_data = models.JSONField(help_text="User input for variable substitution")
    final_output = models.TextField(help_text="Generated prompt content")
    
    # Validation
    is_valid = models.BooleanField(default=False)
    validation_notes = models.JSONField(default=list)
    missing_variables = models.JSONField(default=list)
    
    # Timestamps
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    
    class Meta:
        ordering = ['-created_at']
        indexes = [
            models.Index(fields=['template', 'created_at']),
            models.Index(fields=['is_valid', 'created_at']),
        ]
```

**Field Descriptions**

The `template` foreign key links each generated prompt to its source template, enabling history views and usage analytics.

The `input_data` field stores the complete user input used for generation as a JSON object. This enables regeneration with modified values and audit of generation decisions.

The `final_output` field stores the complete generated prompt content after variable substitution. This is the primary output consumed by users.

The `is_valid` boolean indicates whether the generated prompt passed all BMAD validation checks. This enables quick filtering in history views.

The `validation_notes` field stores an array of validation notes explaining any compliance issues. Notes include severity, message, and affected sections.

The `missing_variables` field stores any template variables that were not replaced during generation. This helps users identify incomplete forms.

## 9. User Interface Design

### 9.1 Design System

The BMAD Forge user interface follows a dark theme design system optimized for developer workflows.

**Color Palette**

The primary color palette uses Bootstrap 5's dark mode colors as a foundation with custom extensions.

Background colors include body background at #212529, card background at #2c3034, and surface backgrounds at #1a1d20. These darker backgrounds reduce eye strain during extended use.

Primary accent color is Bootstrap primary blue (#0d6efd) for primary actions and interactive elements. Secondary colors include success green (#198754) for valid states and validation success, danger red (#dc3545) for errors and invalid states, and warning yellow (#ffc107) for cautions.

Border colors use #495057 for component borders and #6c757d for hover states.

**Typography**

The interface uses system fonts for body text with sans-serif fallbacks. Monospace fonts (Fira Code, Consolas) are used for code display in templates and generated prompts. Font sizes follow Bootstrap 5 defaults with slight adjustments for readability.

**Spacing and Layout**

The interface uses Bootstrap 5's spacing scale (0.25rem increments) for consistent padding and margins. Container widths are 1140px maximum for large screens, with full-width options for specific sections.

### 9.2 Page Layouts

**Base Layout (All Pages)**

The base layout provides consistent navigation and footer across all application pages.

The navigation bar includes the application logo (left), primary navigation links (center-left), and version indicator (right). Navigation collapses to a hamburger menu on mobile devices. The navbar uses the dark background color with light text.

The main content area uses a container with appropriate top padding to account for the fixed navbar. Content is vertically centered on the dashboard homepage.

The footer displays copyright information, a link to the BMAD Framework GitHub repository, and version information. The footer is sticky to the bottom of the viewport for shorter pages.

**Dashboard Page**

The dashboard provides an overview of system status and quick access to common actions.

The page is organized into four horizontal sections. The stats cards row displays four metric cards showing total templates, recent prompts, agent roles count, and workflow phases count.

The recent content section displays two side-by-side panels. The left panel lists recently added templates with badges showing agent role and workflow phase. The right panel lists recently generated prompts with validation status badges.

The quick actions section provides four large buttons arranged horizontally on desktop (stacked on mobile). Each button links to a major feature area with an icon and label.

**Template Library Page**

The template library provides browsing, filtering, and search capabilities.

The page header includes the page title, a description, and a Sync Templates button. Below the header, a filter panel provides controls for agent role dropdown, workflow phase dropdown, and search input. Filters use Bootstrap form controls with dark theme styling.

The template grid displays active templates in responsive cards. Each card shows role and phase badges, title, description preview, variable count, and action buttons (View, Generate). The grid uses CSS Grid with auto-fit columns for responsive behavior.

The empty state displays when no templates match filter criteria, providing guidance on clearing filters or initiating template synchronization.

**Template Detail Page**

The template detail page provides comprehensive template information and generation access.

The page header includes the template title, role/phase/version badges, and a Generate Prompt button. A breadcrumb navigation aid helps users maintain context.

The template details card displays metadata in a two-column table including agent role, workflow phase, variables, creation date, last updated date, and source URL if available.

The variables card displays detected variables as badges with code formatting, helping users understand what input will be required.

The template content card displays the full template markdown with syntax highlighting. A vertical scrollbar enables navigation through long templates.

**Prompt Form Page**

The prompt form page provides dynamic form generation and prompt preview.

The page header maintains context with breadcrumb navigation. The form card displays dynamically generated input fields based on template variables. Form fields use appropriate widgets based on variable naming conventions. Labels are human-readable transformations of variable names.

A template preview section below the form displays the original template content with variable highlighting.

**Prompt Result Page**

The prompt result page displays generated output and validation results.

The page header includes the generated prompt title, role/phase badges, validation status badge, and action buttons (Copy, Download, Regenerate).

A validation alert displays prominently at the top of the content area. Valid prompts show a green success alert. Invalid prompts show a yellow warning alert with issue summary.

The generated prompt display shows the complete output in a syntax-highlighted code block with a vertical scrollbar for long content.

An input data summary table shows all variable names and the values provided during generation.

A validation details section appears only for invalid prompts, listing specific issues with explanations and remediation guidance.

**GitHub Sync Page**

The GitHub sync page provides repository configuration and sync initiation.

The page header includes a page title and description. The sync form includes fields for repository URL, branch name, and path. Pre-populated values suggest defaults from configuration.

A default repository info card displays currently configured repository details.

A sync instructions section provides numbered steps explaining the sync process.

**Prompt History Page**

The prompt history page provides searchable, filterable access to generated prompts.

The page header includes title, description, and status filter buttons (All, Valid, Invalid). The history table displays generated prompts with columns for template, role, phase, created timestamp, validation status, and actions.

Pagination controls appear below the table for large result sets. The empty state guides users to browse templates when no history exists.

### 9.3 Component Specifications

**Badge Component**

Badges display categorical information with consistent styling.

Agent role badges use the secondary (grey) background color with uppercase text. Workflow phase badges use dark background with border. Validation status badges use success green for valid and danger red for invalid.

**Card Component**

Cards display related content with consistent borders and backgrounds. Card headers use semi-transparent backgrounds. Card footers use transparent backgrounds with top borders.

**Button Component**

Primary buttons use primary blue background. Secondary buttons use outline styling with primary text color. Button hover states provide visual feedback through background color changes and subtle shadow.

**Form Component**

Form controls use dark background, light text, and grey borders. Focus states use primary color for border and box-shadow. Error states use danger color for borders and error messages.

**Table Component**

Tables use dark background with light text. Header rows use semi-transparent secondary background. Hover states highlight table rows with slightly lighter background.

    "data": [
        {
            "id": 1,
            "title": "Developer Implementation Template",
            "agent_role": "developer",
            "workflow_phase": "development",
            "description": "Template for implementation prompts",
            "variables": ["feature_description", "technical_requirements"],
            "is_active": true,
            "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
            "last_updated": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"

    "validation_notes": [],
    "missing_variables": [],
    "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:35:00Z"
}
```

### 10.3 Authentication and Rate Limiting

API authentication uses token-based authentication for programmatic access. Tokens are issued through user settings and included in the Authorization header: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.

Rate limiting restricts API calls to prevent abuse. Standard limits are 100 requests per minute for authenticated users and 20 requests per minute for unauthenticated requests. Rate limit headers are included in responses: `X-RateLimit-Limit`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining`, `X-RateLimit-Reset`.

---

## 11. Integration Requirements

### 11.1 GitHub Integration

The GitHub integration enables template synchronization from remote repositories.

**Authentication**

Authentication uses GitHub Personal Access Tokens (PAT). Tokens are stored securely in environment variables and never logged or exposed through APIs. Tokens require read permissions for repository contents.

**API Rate Handling**

GitHub API rate limits (5,000 requests/hour for authenticated requests) are respected. The sync service implements exponential backoff for rate limit errors and provides progress feedback during long operations.

**File Processing**

Template files are identified by extension (.md, .txt, .template). Files are fetched using GitHub Contents API with base64 decoding or from the local stored template folder. Content is parsed and validated before database storage.

**Change Detection**

Sync operations compare remote file modification times with local records. Only changed files are updated. Update operations preserve associations with generated prompts.

**Error Handling**

Network errors trigger retry with exponential backoff. Invalid template files are logged and skipped with detailed error messages. Partial sync results are reported with success/error counts.

### 11.2 No Other External Integrations

BMAD Forge does not require any other external service integrations for core functionality. All dependencies are managed internally or through standard Python packages.

---

## 12. Security Architecture

### 12.1 Authentication Strategy

For the MVP release, no user authentication is required. Access is open to all users with no access control.

Future versions will implement authentication through OAuth 2.0 with GitHub as the primary provider. GitHub authentication leverages existing organizational SSO where applicable and simplifies token management for GitHub integration.

Session management uses Django's built-in secure session handling with configurable session lifetimes. Sessions are stored server-side with session IDs in secure cookies.

### 12.2 Authorization Model

Authorization implements role-based access control with the following roles.

**Administrator Role**  
Administrators have full access to all features including user management, system configuration, template management (create, edit, delete), and all prompt operations.

**Contributor Role**  
Contributors can create and manage their own templates, generate prompts, view all templates and prompts, and export prompt history.

**Viewer Role**  
Viewers can view all templates and prompts and export prompt history. Viewers cannot create templates or generate prompts.

### 12.3 Data Protection

**Encryption**  
All data is encrypted in transit using HTTPS/TLS. Data at rest encryption is provided by the underlying database system (SQLite or PostgreSQL). Sensitive configuration values are stored in environment variables.

**Input Sanitization**  
All user inputs are validated on the server side. Template content is sanitized before display to prevent XSS attacks. File uploads validate file types and sizes.

**Access Control**  
Database access is restricted to application processes. API endpoints validate authorization for protected operations. Audit logging tracks all data modifications.

### 12.4 Privacy Considerations

The application does not collect personally identifiable information beyond user-provided data. Template and prompt data is considered organizational intellectual property and protected accordingly. Data export capabilities support organizational compliance requirements.

---

## 13. Testing Requirements

### 13.1 Unit Testing

Unit tests verify individual component functionality in isolation.

**Model Tests**  
Tests cover all model methods including variable extraction, prompt generation, and validation status calculation. Tests verify model relationships and constraints.

**Service Tests**  
Tests cover all service methods including template parsing, variable detection, validation logic, and GitHub synchronization. Tests use mocked external dependencies.

**View Tests**  
Tests cover view logic including template selection, form rendering, and redirect handling. Tests verify authentication and authorization enforcement.

**Form Tests**  
Tests cover form field generation based on template variables and form validation.

### 13.2 Integration Testing

Integration tests verify component interactions and end-to-end workflows.

**Prompt Generation Flow**  
Tests verify the complete flow from template selection through form submission to prompt generation and validation.

**Sync Workflow**  
Tests verify GitHub synchronization including API authentication, file parsing, and database updates.

**Validation Logic**  
Tests verify validation correctly identifies missing sections, unreplaced variables, and other compliance issues.

### 13.3 Test Coverage Requirements

Minimum test coverage requirements are 80% for models, 80% for services, and 60% for views. Overall project coverage must exceed 75%.

### 13.4 Testing Tools

Testing uses pytest as the test runner with pytest-django for Django integration. Tests are located in the `tests/` directory with organized test files matching application modules. Test fixtures provide sample templates and prompts for consistent test data.

---

## 14. Deployment Strategy

### 14.1 Environment Configuration

The application supports three environment configurations.

**Development Environment**  
SQLite database, debug mode enabled, minimal security settings, local file storage for static files.

**Staging Environment**  
PostgreSQL database, debug mode disabled, production-like security settings, Content Delivery Network for static files.

**Production Environment**  
PostgreSQL database with high availability configuration, debug mode disabled, full security hardening, load balancer with SSL termination, CDN for static files, monitoring and alerting enabled.

### 14.2 Container Support

The application is container-ready with a Dockerfile for Docker deployments. Containers use multi-stage builds for efficient image sizes. Container orchestration uses Kubernetes or Docker Compose depending on deployment scale.

### 14.3 CI/CD Pipeline

Continuous integration runs all tests on every pull request. Automated security scanning identifies vulnerabilities in dependencies. Continuous deployment triggers on main branch merges to staging, with manual promotion to production.

### 14.4 Database Migrations

Database migrations are managed through Django's migration system. Migrations are tested against both SQLite and PostgreSQL. Migration execution is automated during deployment with rollback capability.

### 14.5 Rollback Strategy

Application rollback reverts to previous container image. Database rollback uses Django migrations with the ability to migrate forward or backward. Static asset versioning enables instant rollbacks through URL changes.
